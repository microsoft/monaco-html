# Monaco HTML


HTML language plugin for the Monaco Editor. It provides the following features when editing HTML files:
* Code completion(javascript && css)
* Formatting
* Document Highlights
* Link detection
* Syntax highlighting

Internally the HTML plugin uses the [vscode-html-languageservice](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-html-languageservice)
node module, providing the implementation of the functionally listed above. The same module is also used
in [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) to power the HTML editing experience.

This package is the update of the branch  'rebornix/EmbeddedLanguage'
